bib_analysis.py is a python script to run co-citation analysis and bibliographic coupling on a dataset provided by the user.
It takes a CSV file where each row represents a unique paper. One column contains the paperâ€™s title and another column contains the list of references cited by that paper, separated by a semi-colon.

The script produces csv outputs (node and edge lists) that can be used in Gephi to visualise bibliographic coupling and co-citation networks.

The script can be useful for analysing bibliometric data that is not indexed in the most commonly used databases, such as Scopus and Web of Science.
